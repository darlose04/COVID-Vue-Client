      ) to access the data gathered by JHU. The data provided by the API comes
      from the Daily Report and Time Series directories in the JHU Github
      repository. There are some differences in statistics that are presented
      here. For example, the Daily Report information is displayed in the States
      / Territories list, while information for the charts is gathered from the
      Time Series directories. In some cases the numbers do not exactly line up.
      This is due to differences between the two directories regarding available
      data .
